# KivyCarPI
Raspberry Pi Car infotainment system for SDD Major project
The goal of this project is to build a Car infotainment system using Python and a UI toolkit called Kivy. The system would allow for a Bluetooth connection to a phone for playing music whilst traveling displaying song name, artist and album.  Bluetooth is a short range protocol which uses radio waves to transfer data between two devices securely. When requested the system will display the cars internal data through a 16 pin output called OBD-2 which underneath the steering wheel of every car since 2001. This port is used by mechanics to service and check the car’s Engine Control Unit(ECU) but it can also output data such as speed, Rpm and fuel levels which is what I will use it for. These will be shown through gauges that move when the data changes they will be reprogrammable as per the users requirements. The system will automatically display a reverse camera and distance sensor data when the car is reversing the sensors will output a beeping to indicate distance as well as display proximity through a simplified image of the car. This will be built using a Raspberry Pi as the computer. Therefore a function to automatically turn off the computer is required. I have found examples of this type of project but they have a very ‘clunky’ or poor quality interface and do not provide the control or features I would like.
